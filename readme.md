# Flask jQuery/AJAX form

## Functionality

User selects a *department* from a drop down list. Once selected, an AJAX request is sent with the *department_id* to the server-side to grab the appropriate *employee* and *employee_id* based on the *department_id*. The JSON data response sent back contains the *employee* that populates a second drop down list.
